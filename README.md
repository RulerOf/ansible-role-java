Install and configure java on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.java
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
---
- name: Default
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```
